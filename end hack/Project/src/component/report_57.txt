If he has no side effects noticed, he can increase to 20 mg daily. We booked the patient for liver function at 2 months. We will repeat his fasting lipid and liver function in 6 months. Regarding his right thumb, most likely it is tendinitis. No evidence to suggest a fracture. The patient may take NSAID p.r.n. for symptom control. He will let us know if his symptom does not improve by NSAIDs.
Regarding the patientâ€™s strong family history of breast cancer, we discussed management and recommended gene screen for the family members. We will continue annual breast exam.
