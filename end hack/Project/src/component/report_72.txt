IMPRESSION AND PLAN: The patient is a (XX)-year-old woman who is generally doing well, although she has history of multiple issues.
1. Health maintenance: Her vaccines are up to date. I recommended a flu shot. Cancer screening is up to date, and she has plans to see the gynecologist for annual Pap smear. Her lipids last year were fine with an LDL 146, HDL of 70, triglycerides of 54. I recommended repeat this fasting, sometime in the next 6-12 months. We talked about appropriate amounts of calcium, vitamin D and weightbearing exercise for her osteoporosis. She is going to continue the Fosamax, which she is tolerating. Repeat bone density due in 18 months.
2. Diverticulosis: We reviewed the colonoscopy report from her recent scope. We talked about high-fiber diet. We have e-mailed her the up-to-date handout on diverticulosis. We discussed that if she gets recurrent lower abdominal symptoms, especially fever or persistent pain, then she should be evaluated as she is at risk for recurrent bouts of diverticulitis.
3. Depression and anxiety, seem well controlled on her current regimen.
4. Skin cancer history: Reinforced sunscreen, and she sees a dermatologist regularly.
The patient is going to return to see me for an annual health assessment.
