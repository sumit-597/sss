Usage
1. Setup
Clone the repository to your local machine and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/reportalyzer.git
cd reportalyzer
2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have the necessary libraries for data processing, visualization, and reporting. For example:

Pandas for data manipulation

Generates reports based on processed data:

Purpose: Creates customized reports in various formats (PDF, Excel, CSV).
Key Functions:
Generates detailed, formatted reports for different stakeholders.
Allows users to customize report templates (e.g., charts, tables, and insights).
3. DataVisualizer Class
Visualizes the data using different chart types:

Purpose: Generates graphical representations such as bar, line, and pie charts.
Key Functions:
Visualizes trends and distributions from the dataset.
Creates and displays interactive dashboards for real-time monitoring.
4. Dashboard
An interactive feature that allows users to visualize key metrics in real time:

Key Features:
Customizable widgets to track metrics like trends, anomalies, and other key performance indicators.
Logging
The tool logs significant actions for traceability:

Data Processing Logs: Records data cleaning and transformation steps.
Report Generation Logs: Tracks when reports are generated and exported.
Email Logs: Logs email notifications that are sent to users.
Important Notes
Educational Use Only: This tool is intended for educational and research purposes to demonstrate data analysis and report generation.
